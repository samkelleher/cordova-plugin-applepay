# Cordova Apple Pay Plugin
> A dependency free Cordova plugin to provide Apple Pay functionality.

Updated to provide additional data access to the plugin, test calls, and compatibility
with newer versions of Cordova. Uses a Promise based interface in JavaScript.

This plugin is compatible with any payment processor (eg Stripe, Adyen etc) because
the payment token is handled back your JavaScript application to pass to which ever payment
processor you use.

## Installation
```
$ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-applepay
```

Install the plugin using Cordova 6 and above, which is based on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-applepay). The plugin
exposes the `window.ApplePay` global in the browser.


## Compatibility

- iOS 9 (using newer iOS9 only APIs)
- iOS 8 (using initial Apple Pay APIs from iOS8 that are deprecated in iOS9)
- iOS 7 and older (no Apple Pay, but doesn't affect code)
- Requires Cordova 6 running at least iOS Platform 4.1.1

## Methods
The methods available all return promises, or accept success and error callbacks.
- ApplePay.canMakePayments
- ApplePay.makePaymentRequest
- ApplePay.completeLastTransaction

## ApplePay.canMakePayments
Detects if the current device supports Apple Pay and has any *capable* cards registered.

```
ApplePay.canMakePayments()
    .then((message) => {
        // Apple Pay is enabled and a supported card is setup. Expect:
        // 'This device can make payments and has a supported card'
    })
    .catch((message) => {
        // There is an issue, examine the message to see the details, will be:
        // 'This device cannot make payments.''
        // 'This device can make payments but has no supported cards'
    });
```

If in your `catch` you get the message `This device can make payments but has no supported cards` - you can decide if you want to handle this by showing the 'Setup Apple Pay' buttons instead of the
normal 'Pay with Apple Bay' buttons as per the Apple Guidelines.

## ApplePay.makePaymentRequest
Request a payment with Apple Pay, returns a Promise that once resolved, has the payment token.
In your `order`, you will set parameters like the merchant ID, country, address requirements,
order information etc. See a full example of an order at the end of this document.

```
ApplePay.makePaymentRequest(order)
    .then((paymentResponse) => {
        // User approved payment, token generated.
    })
    .catch((message) => {
        // Error or user cancelled.
    });
```

### Example Response

The `paymentResponse` is an object with the keys that contain the token itself,
this is what you'll need to pass along to your payment processor. Also, if you requested
billing or shipping addresses, this information is also included.

```
{
    "shippingAddressState": "London",
    "shippingCountry": "United Kingdom",
    "shippingISOCountryCode": "gb",
    "billingAddressCity": "London",
    "billingISOCountryCode": "gb",
    "shippingNameLast": "Name",
    "paymentData": "<BASE64 ENCODED TOKEN WILL APPEAR HERE>",
    "shippingNameFirst": "First",
    "billingAddressState": "London",
    "billingAddressStreet": "Street 1\n",
    "billingNameFirst": "First",
    "billingPostalCode": "POST CODE",
    "shippingPostalCode": "POST CODE",
    "shippingAddressStreet": "Street Line 1\nStreet Line 2",
    "billingNameLast": "NAME",
    "billingSupplementarySubLocality": "",
    "billingCountry": "United Kingdom",
    "shippingAddressCity": "London",
    "shippingSupplementarySubLocality": "",
    "transactionIdentifier": "Simulated Identifier",
    "paymentMethodDisplayName": "MasterCard 1234",
    "paymentMethodNetwork": "MasterCard",
    "paymentMethodTypeCard": "credit"
}
```

## ApplePay.completeLastTransaction
Once the makePaymentRequest has been resolved successfully, the device will be waiting for a completion event.
This means, that the application must proceed with the token authorisation and return a success, failure, or other validation error. Once this has been passed back, the Apple Pay sheet will be dismissed via an animation.

```
ApplePay.completeLastTransaction('success');
```

You can dismiss or invalidate the Apple Pay sheet by calling `completeLastTransaction` with a status string which can be `success`, `failure`, `invalid-billing-address`, `invalid-shipping-address`, `invalid-shipping-contact`, `require-pin`, `incorrect-pin`, `locked-pin`.

### Payment Flow Example

The order request object closely follows the format of the `PKPaymentRequest` class and thus its [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/PassKit/Reference/PKPaymentRequest_Ref/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/cl/PKPaymentRequest) will make excellent reading.

```
ApplePay.makePaymentRequest(
    {
          items: [
              {
                  label: '3 x Basket Items',
                  amount: 49.99
              },
              {
                  label: 'Next Day Delivery',
                  amount: 3.99
              },
                      {
                  label: 'My Fashion Company',
                  amount: 53.98
              }
          ],
          shippingMethods: [
              {
                  identifier: 'NextDay',
                  label: 'NextDay',
                  detail: 'Arrives tomorrow by 5pm.',
                  amount: 3.99
              },
              {
                  identifier: 'Standard',
                  label: 'Standard',
                  detail: 'Arrive by Friday.',
                  amount: 4.99
              },
              {
                  identifier: 'SaturdayDelivery',
                  label: 'Saturday',
                  detail: 'Arrive by 5pm this Saturday.',
                  amount: 6.99
              }
          ],
          merchantIdentifier: 'merchant.apple.test',
          currencyCode: 'GBP',
          countryCode: 'GB',
          billingAddressRequirement: 'none',
          shippingAddressRequirement: 'none',
          shippingType: 'shipping'
    })
    .then((paymentResponse) => {
        // The user has authorized the payment.

        // Handle the token, asynchronously, i.e. pass to your merchant bank to
        // action the payment, then once finished, depending on the outcome:

        // Here is an example implementation:

        // MyPaymentProvider.authorizeApplePayToken(token.paymentData)
        //    .then((captureStatus) => {
        //        // Displays the 'done' green tick and closes the sheet.
        //        ApplePay.completeLastTransaction('success');
        //    })
        //    .catch((err) => {
        //        // Displays the 'failed' red cross.
        //        ApplePay.completeLastTransaction('failure');
        //    });


    })
    .catch((e) => {
        // Failed to open the Apple Pay sheet, or the user cancelled the payment.
    })
```

Valid values for the `shippingType` are:

 * `shipping` (default)
 * `delivery`
 * `store`
 * `service`

Valid values for the `billingAddressRequirement` and `shippingAddressRequirement`
properties are:

 * `none` (default)
 * `all`
 * `postcode`
 * `name`
 * `email`
 * `phone`

## Limitations and TODOs
* *Supported Payment Networks hard coded* (Visa, Mastercard, American Express) - This should be updated to be passed along in the order, but is rarely changed and trivial to alter in code.
* *Merchant Capabilities hard coded (3DS)* - This should be updated to be passed along in the order, but is rarely changed and trivial to alter in code.
* *Event binds for delivery method selector* - An event can be raised when the customer
selects different delivery options, so the merchant can update the delivery charges.
